# Masalameal — GitHub Pages Ready

A simple, responsive front‑end for an Indian restaurant menu and demo order cart.

## Quick start
1. Create a new GitHub repository named **Masalameal** (or any name).
2. Upload the files from this folder (or drag-and-drop the zip contents).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - **Build and deployment**: Source = **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch = **main** (or `master`), Folder = **/** (root)
   - Click **Save**.
4. Wait ~1 minute. Your site will be live at:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

> This project uses only static files (HTML/CSS/JS), so it works perfectly with GitHub Pages. No frameworks or build step required.

## Local preview
Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customization
- Replace placeholder images in `assets/img/` with your own food photos (keep the same filenames or update paths in `assets/js/app.js`).
- Edit menu items and prices inside `assets/js/app.js` (the `MENU` array).
- Change colours in `assets/css/style.css`.

## Notes
- Project name and brand are **Masalameal** (requested change from 'masalamitra').
- The order flow is a **front‑end demo only** (no backend/payments).

Enjoy!
